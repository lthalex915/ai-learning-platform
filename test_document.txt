Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. This field has revolutionized many industries and continues to grow rapidly.

Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error

Applications:
Machine learning is used in various fields including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Examples include recommendation systems, fraud detection, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis.

Conclusion:
Understanding machine learning fundamentals is essential for students entering the technology field. It provides the foundation for more advanced topics in artificial intelligence and data science.
